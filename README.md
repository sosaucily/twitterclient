Twitter Client
==============

![Alt text](./twitterclient_2.gif?raw=true "Optional Title")

Was able to get all the required features:

* User can sign in using OAuth login flow
* User can view last 20 tweets from their home timeline
* The current signed in user will be persisted across restarts
* In the home timeline, user can view tweet with the user profile picture, username, tweet text, and timestamp. In other words, design the custom cell with the proper Auto Layout settings. You will also need to augment the model classes.
* User can pull to refresh
* User can compose a new tweet by tapping on a compose button.
* User can tap on a tweet to view it, with controls to retweet, favorite, and reply.

also:
Optional: Replies should be prefixed with the username

This took about 12 hrs
